# Crash Game

A local **Crash** gambling game simulation playable in the terminal — designed purely for fun and practice, with no real money involved.

## About

This project is a simple terminal-based crash game where you start with a virtual balance and place bets. The multiplier increases over time, and you try to cash out before it crashes. It’s a personal project to explore game mechanics and terminal interaction in Python.

## How to Play

- You start with a virtual balance (default: 100).
- Enter your bet amount each round.
- Watch the multiplier grow in real-time.
- Press **Enter** anytime to cash out and collect winnings based on the current multiplier.
- If the multiplier crashes before you cash out, you lose your bet.
- The game continues until you exit (Ctrl+C).


## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the game:

```bash
python crash.py
```
